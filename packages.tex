% Essential packages that provide fundamental functionality shared across
% multiple feature modules. Feature-specific packages are loaded in their
% respective feature files (listings.tex, diagrams.tex, tables.tex, etc.).

\usepackage{graphicx}

% Color support (required by diagrams, listings, and other color features)
